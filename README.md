## Hi, I’m Siergej Sobolewski



-  👋  I like doing it, it's nice to see the implementation of 
       my work,  I always  strive  for new  knowledge  and new 
       implementations.I believe, people working in Data Science
       have carved out a unique and distinct field for the work
       they do.

      

- 👀  I believe, people working in data science have carved 
      out a unique and distinct field  for the work  they do.  
      The ancient  Egyptians used  census  data to  increase 
      efficiency  in  tax  collection and  they  accurately 
      predicted the flooding of the  Nile river  every year. 
      That еhe art of uncovering the insights and trends in 
      data has been around since ancient times.
